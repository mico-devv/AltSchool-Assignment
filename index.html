    <h1>My Engineering Profile</h1>

    <h2>Basic Information</h2>
        <p><strong>Full Name:</strong> Okoye Michael</p>
        <p><strong>AltSchool ID:</strong> ALT/SOE/025/0321</p>

    <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>I'm Okoye Michael, a creative thinker with a passion for technology and problem-solving. I enjoy exploring how digital products are built and finding ways to improve user experiences through both design and development. My curiosity and drive for continuous learning have led me to expand my skill set beyond design into front-end engineering. By mastering the technical side of product development, I aim to bridge the gap between creativity and functionality, building intuitive and efficient digital experiences.</p>

    <h2>Why I Joined the AltSchool School of Engineering Program:</h2>
        <p>As a designer, I’ve always worked closely with engineers, translating ideas into user interfaces. However, I realized that to truly bring my vision to life, I needed to understand the technical side of things—how the code behind the interface functions. This realization led me to the AltSchool School of Engineering program. I want to strengthen my front-end development skills so that I can transition into a design engineering role, allowing me to merge creativity with technical implementation.</p>
